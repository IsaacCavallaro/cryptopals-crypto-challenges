# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges Solutions

This project documents my journey through the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/) and provides solutions to each challenge.

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for solving the Cryptopals challenges. Each challenge is in its own file, organised by set. The goal of this project is to not only solve the challenges but also to provide clear, documented solutions for anyone following along.

## How to Install Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository from GitHub:

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

# How to Run the Scripts

Each challenge script is located in the `src/set_{x}/` directory and can be run individually. Here's how you can run them:

1. Activate the Virtual Environment
Before running any script, ensure your virtual environment is activated:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

2. Run a Challenge Script
For example, to run Challenge One:

```bash
python src/set_one/challenge_one.py
```
